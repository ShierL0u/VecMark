Individuals with CFS frequently report digestive issues as well. Notably, these individuals are more prone to have previously received an irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) diagnosis, a frequent condition affecting the gut, and often encounter symptoms characteristic of IBS. Emerging research highlights that interactions among gut bacteria, the integrity of the mucosal lining, and the immune system can influence the onset of CFS. Investigations into the microbial environment of the gut have revealed certain microbes that seem linked to the condition."
