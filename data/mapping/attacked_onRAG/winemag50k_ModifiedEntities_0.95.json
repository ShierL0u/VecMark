        "Answer": "This wine features a robust black fruit flavor profile enlivened by notes of grilled meat on cedar planks alongside subtle herbaceous undertones. Rich and dark, flavors of blackberry, plum flesh, cigar box, licorice and pepper dance in the mouth and stay through the solid finish. Fine but firm tannins provide structure and texture, and the wine, though delicious now, should age nicely through 2014."
